        <p class="info">Command blocks are kind of how they sound, because you can input commands for all kinds of crazy stuff(and it's packed into a block)</p>

        <p class="info">One of the first things you want to do is probably <i>get</i> a command block.</p>
        <p class="info">Unlike most blocks, you can't craft it or get it from your inventory, you have to get by a command.</p>
        <p class="info">The command to get one is:</p><code class="code"> /give @p command_block</code>
        <p class="info">Some basic commands to learn first are probably basic teleportation commands, e.g.</p> <code class="code">/teleport @p 200 70 100</code>

        <p class="info">Something you can do if you need a command is use chatGPT. ChatGPT knows a lot of commands, so ask away!</p> <p class="info">One thing I did for fun is I made a list of commands for myself. This is a fun activity if you want to keep track of what you know.</p>
        <p class="info">Some names for them I made (the commands of some of them are listed below) are</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ignite</li>
          <li>Controlled blow up</li>
          <li>Chaos Command</li>
          <li>Home Base Teleport</li>
          <li>Get a Command Block</li>

        <p class="info">If you still want to learn more commands from me, then this is your section.</p>
        <p class="info">Warning! These commands can be very destructive, and in the case of the Chaos Command wreck your world if not used carefully!</p>
        <p class="info">(note: you can fix repetitive teleportations that lock you out by adjusting tick speed)</p>
        <code class="code">/summon minecraft:tnt 100 50 70 60</code>
